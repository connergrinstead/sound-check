# Sound Check

This tool was created to simplify the process of identifying engine irregularities from the sound.

It may only be used on recordings at idle, without significant changes in throttle position.

A regular sequence of many points can indicate a healthy stroke cycle, while less points, more irregularly placed, may point to a problem with the engine tuning.

The following image shows a healthy stroke sequence:
